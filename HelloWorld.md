To fulfill what was asked, we have here :point_down:
## This is a markdown file


Now let's try some other features... :clap::smirk:
# This is a Primary Heading
## This is a Secondary Heading
### This is a Tertiary Heading

Let's try to make a table?  :shipit: Here we go!

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column


That's it. Have a nice day!!  :smiley:
